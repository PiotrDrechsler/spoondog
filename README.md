## `SectionHeading` Component

The `SectionHeading` component is used to display section headings on our page. Its main purpose is to provide a semantic structure for headings, which improves SEO and enhances content readability.

### Props

- **`sectionTitle?: string`**  
  An optional section title that will be displayed as a paragraph above the main headings. It defaults to an empty string.

- **`sectionMainHeading: React.ReactNode`**  
  The main section heading, rendered as an `<h2>` tag. It is expected that this property will contain significant text, which is important for SEO.

- **`sectionInfo: React.ReactNode`**  
  Additional information about the section, rendered as an `<h3>` tag. HTML tags like `<strong>` can be used for better semantics and SEO.

- **`variant?: "opinions-section" | "default-section"`**  
  An optional prop that controls the layout style of the heading. 
  - When the value is `"opinions-section"`, the main heading (`<h2>`) will have a maximum width of 230px [for mobile devices], which is useful for specific design needs where the heading should be constrained in width.
  - The default value is `"default-section"`, where no specific width is applied to the main heading.

<SectionHeading
  sectionTitle="My Section"
  sectionMainHeading="Main Heading"
